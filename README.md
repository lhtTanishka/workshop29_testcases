This repository contains JavaScript test scripts for API testing using Postman. The scripts check important aspects such as response status codes, JSON format, data structure, and specific field validations. You can edit and save these scripts easily in VS Code for better version control and reuse. To run the tests, copy the code from these files into the Tests tab of your Postman requests and execute the API calls to see the test results. This approach helps maintain organized, reusable, and shareable API test cases for effective API validation.
